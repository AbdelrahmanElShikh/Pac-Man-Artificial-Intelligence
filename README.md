As this project concerns with The Ai I only implemented the part of the Pac-man and ghosts that the Pac-man can’t go inside the wall (he recognize the walls and stop waiting the player to move him to another position) and the Ghost follow the Pac-Man “using Breadth first Search Algorithm” and if they touched themselves the ghost disappear as a mark that he reached his destination .
